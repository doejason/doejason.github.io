## 2Q review; tariffs at the mercy of external forces

- Hyundai Motor’s (HMC) 2Q operating profit came in line with consensus, with tariff impact offset by won weakness.
- With US tariffs on Japanese autos set at 15% and reciprocal tariffs between the US and Europe reportedly around 15%, attention is on the outcome of tariff negotiations between Korea and the US.
- Share price is likely to be stagnant until structural winners and losers from US tariffs are clearly defined.

## WHAT'S THE STORY?

### 2Q results meet consensus:
- Tariffs cost Hyundai Motor (HMC) KRW828b, nearly KRW400b a month.

### Sales hit KRW48.3t (up 8.7% q-q and 7.3% y-y):
- HMC reported global wholesales (excluding China) of 1.04m units (up 6.5% q-q and 1.3% y-y). The auto and financial divisions contributed sales of KRW37t (up 6.7% q-q and 5.1% y-y) and KRW8.3t (up 11.8% q-q and 16.4% y-y), respectively.

### Gross margin slips 0.5%pts y-y to 18.9%:
- HMC’s global ASP rose to USD25,600 (up 3.9% q-q and 1.6% y-y), supported by a domestic market recovery and the launch of the Santa Fe hybrid. Gross margin fell, impacted by US tariffs.

### Operating margin drops 2%pts y-y to 7.5%:
- Tariff impact started to be felt in May and reached KRW828b. Won weakness boosted the firm’s operating profit by KRW632b y-y, while incentive hikes outside the US eroded the figure by KRW740b y-y.

### Auto division’s operating margin down 4.5%pts y-y at 6.1%:
- The auto division’s sales rose 95.1% y-y to KRW37t as US consumers rushed to buy cars ahead of potential price hikes and on greater hybrid sales (169,000 units; up 38.5% y-y). But its profitability slowed, impacted by higher incentives (up KRW740b y-y). US incentives turned downward, falling 6.2% y-y to USD2,936 per vehicle in 2Q.
