## Tech (OVERWEIGHT)
### Samsung foundry wins a massive order

- Samsung Electronics (SEC) announced today that it has signed a USD16.5b chip contract with an unidentified global company. The deal should generate USD3b in annual sales from 2028 at Taylor, Texas fab—equivalent to 23% of SEC's 2024 foundry revenue.

- Among SEC's supply chain vendors, those with significant exposure to its foundry business or a track record of supplying the division—and particularly those tied to the Taylor fab—are likely to outperform.

- Key beneficiaries should include Soulbrain, S&S Tech, and Dongjin Semichem in materials, and Wonik IPS and STI in equipment.

## WHAT'S THE STORY?

### SEC wins massive foundry order:
Samsung Electronics (SEC) today announced that it has won a KRW22.8t (USD16.5b) chip contract from a global tech giant, with the deal running from Jul 2025 through Dec 2033. The chips, believed to be for data centers and robotics, are expected to enter mass-production at SEC's Taylor, Texas fab starting in 2028.

The deal marks a positive for both SEC and its supply chain. First, the contract should contribute USD16.5b in revenue over 5.5 years from 2H28, translating to around USD3b in annual foundry sales—equivalent to 23% of SEC's 2024 foundry revenue of USD13.1b. Second, it diversifies SEC's foundry end markets, which are currently heavily weighted towards smartphones. Third, the contract strengthens the client base for the Texas fab, improving the long-term viability of the company’s US foundry operations.

### Investment ideas—focus on the supply chain:
With the contract extending through end-2033, SEC's supply chain vendors stand to benefit over the medium-to-long term. Those with high exposure to the foundry business or a proven track record with SEC are best positioned, especially companies linked to the Taylor fab.

- **Materials:** Likely beneficiaries include Soulbrain (357780; not rated), Hansol Chemical (014680; BUY), S&S Tech (101490; not rated), and Dongjin Semichem (005290; not rated). Soulbrain is believed to be the exclusive supplier of etchants used in SEC's 3 nm process for Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistor architecture. Soulbrain is reportedly planning to expand capacity near the Taylor site.
