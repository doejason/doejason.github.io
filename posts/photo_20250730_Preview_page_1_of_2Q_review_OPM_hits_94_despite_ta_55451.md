## Kia (000270)

### 2Q review: OPM hits 9.4% despite tariffs

- Despite all-time high sales in 2Q, Kia’s operating profit shrank 24% y-y, due to tariff impact (KRW786b), aging models, and higher incentives. Meanwhile, with an operating margin of 9.4%, it likely maintained the world’s highest profitability.
- Kia will be able to mitigate 30% of tariff impact in 2H by relocating production, saving on compliance costs amid environmental deregulation, and cutting incentive spends. Kia aims to expand its US market share from 5.1% in 1H to 6% in 2H by increasing the supply of hybrids.
- Buybacks are protecting against share price downside, while its expanding market shares in the US and European EV markets should shed light on its growth momentum. Kia remains among our top picks.

## WHAT'S THE STORY?

### 2Q results decent, in light of tariffs and aging models:

- **Tariffs cost Kia KRW786b in 2Q.** Given its efforts to mitigate the impact, we estimate the tariff impact in 2H to be KRW280b per month.
- **Sales hit all-time high of KRW29.35t (up 6.5% y-y):** Kia’s global wholesale volume rose 2.5% y-y to an all-time high of 861,000 units. Its global ASP stood at USD26,300 (up 1.6% y-y).
- **Gross margin hits 20% (down 1.7%pts q-q and 4.1%pts y-y):** Tariffs squeezed gross margin by 2.6%pts y-y. Incentive spends increased. Raw material costs fell by KRW50b y-y.
