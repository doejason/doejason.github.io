# Samsung E&A (028050)

## 2Q review; 1H was good, but 2H to be better

- Samsung E&A reported 2Q consolidated operating profit of KRW180.9b, which topped consensus of KRW162b by 11.6%.
- The solid results were attributable to: 1) full-scale revenue recognition from the Fadhili project in Saudi Arabia; and 2) improvement in profitability at non-hydrocarbon projects based on better cost efficiency (gross margin of 16.4%).
- We recommend investors keep an eye on the company in 2H on prospects of solid hydrocarbon earnings (driven by the Fadhili project), massive hydrocarbon orders, and non-captive orders (non-hydrocarbon projects).

## WHAT'S THE STORY?

### 2Q review:
Samsung E&A reported 2Q results showing consolidated sales of KRW2.17t (down 18.9% y-y) and operating profit of KRW180.9b (down 31.1% y-y; beating FnGuide-based consensus of KRW162b by 11.6%), for an operating margin of 8%. The solid results owed much to: 1) growing hydrocarbon sales based on full-scale revenue recognition from the Fadhili project in Saudi Arabia; and 2) improvement in profitability for better cost efficiency and settlement for cost-overruns—specifically, gross margin from hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon projects came to a respective 13.2% and 16.4%.

### 2H earnings and new orders to head north h-h:
Hydrocarbon sales should trend higher in 2H25, backed by full-scale revenue recognition from the Fadhili project in Saudi Arabia. The company won KRW2.6t worth new orders in 1H25 (equivalent to only 23% of the full-year guidance of KRW11.5t), but we predict solid new order momentum in 2H25—eg, the USD3.5b SAN-6 blue ammonia project in Saudi Arabia, the USD3.5b NGL-5 gas project in Qatar, the USD1.5b ADNOC Shah project in the UAE, and the USD3b UAE Taaiz Salt project.
