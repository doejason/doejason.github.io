# LG Energy Solution (373220)

## 2Q review: Shifts focus to ESS amid EV downturn

- In line with a preliminary announcement on Jul 7, LG Energy Solution reported a 2Q operating profit of KRW492.2b (up 31% q-q), beating consensus (KRW315b) thanks to GM’s inventory buildup and improved profitability on ESS.
- LGES has been converting EV lines for ESS production, in response to a US EV slump. With premiums emerging for locally produced ESS under revised IRA policies, the company has decided to expand the shift to ESS.
- Reflecting the shift to ESS, we raise our forecast of 2026 net profit attributable to controlling interests by 30%. Also, believing quarterly net profit ended its downtrend in 2Q, we raise our target price and investment rating.

## WHAT’S THE STORY?

### 2Q results beat consensus: 
In line with a preliminary announcement on Jul 7, LG Energy Solution reported a 2Q operating profit of KRW492.2b (up 31% q-q), sharply beating FnGuide consensus (KRW315b) and our forecast (KRW313.9b). Sale volume to its JV with GM rose further, contrary to expectations of a q-q fall, leading to a surprisingly strong IRA AMPC and EV battery mix improvements.

### Small batteries: 
Its small-battery business recorded estimated sales of KRW1.64t (down 4% q-q) and an operating profit of KRW89.6b (down 24% q-q) for a margin of 5.5%. US dollar-based ASP fell 3% q-q (vs a 7% q-q rise in 1Q). Shipment volume rebounded 2% q-q (vs a 5% q-q decline in 1Q), despite sluggish IT-bound shipments, thanks to a leading EV maker’s introduction of new models.
