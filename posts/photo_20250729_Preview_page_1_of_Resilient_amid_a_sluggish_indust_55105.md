# Cheil Worldwide (030000)
**Resilient amid a sluggish industry recovery**

- Cheil Worldwide logged a 2Q operating profit of KRW92.1b, up 4.4% y-y and meeting consensus. Its pre-tax and net profits, however, missed market forecasts.
- Reflecting current market conditions, the agency lowered its full-year operating profit guidance from ‘a y-y increase’ to ‘flat y-y’.
- Its strong commitment to shareholder returns suggests its total dividend payment will remain flat y-y, at the least.

## WHAT’S THE STORY?

### 2Q review:
Cheil Worldwide reported a 2Q25 gross profit of KRW483.8b (up 6.7% y-y) and operating profit of KRW92.1b (up 4.4% y-y; meeting consensus). Despite the slower-than-anticipated recovery of industry conditions, the agency sustained the topline growth based on digital and above-the-line (ATL) ads. Gross margin at the parent and consolidated subsidiaries rose 0.9% and 8.4% y-y, respectively. Its overseas gross margin improved on M&A effects—e.g., a US marketing firm (acquired by subsidiary McKinney in Dec 2024) became subject to consolidated earnings in 1Q25. Yet, Cheil Worldwide incurred a non-operating loss of KRW17.4b on forex losses (stemming from depreciation of the won against the US dollar), leading to y-y decline of 19.8% in pre-tax profit and 21.4% in net profit attributable to controlling shareholders.
