# Samsung Heavy Industries (010140)
## Signs of margin improvement strengthening

- Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) reported a stellar margin in 2Q, which we attribute to larger-than-expected effects of its sales mix improvement.
- SHI suffered more from negative impacts of low-priced orders (it took before 2022) vs its rivals, given the firm’s 100% hedging policy. Now that the firm has few low-priced orders left in its order backlog, it is expected to see profitability improve faster than its rivals.
- The firm should see valuation burden ease on upward earnings revisions, and should enjoy FLNG order momentum.

## WHAT'S THE STORY?

### 2Q review:
Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) announced that its 2Q operating profit grew 66% q-q, beating market consensus by 12%, with its operating margin hitting 7.6% (the highest since 2Q14). This marks earlier-than-expected improvement in profitability, which we attribute to quicker-than-expected delivery of low-priced vessels and faster-than-expected expansion in high-margin FLNG sales. Pre-tax profit includes a one-off cost in relation to the cancellation of a Russian project. However, such a one-off cost was offset by valuation gains on the Russian project-related derivatives product. On top of this, recognition of lower-than-expected income taxes drove the firm’s net profit beating consensus by 31%.
