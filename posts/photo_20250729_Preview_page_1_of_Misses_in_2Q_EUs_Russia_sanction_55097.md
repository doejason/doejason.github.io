# S-Oil (010950)

**Misses in 2Q; EU’s Russia sanctions to be boon in 2H**

- S-Oil reported a 2Q operating loss of KRW344b (worsening KRW96.7b q-q), missing consensus (loss of KRW247.3b), as the refining unit suffered massive losses due to won appreciation against the US dollar and a q-q oil price drop.
- Strong electricity demand during the summer and the EU’s recent announcement of tougher Russia sanctions should further tighten diesel/kerosene supply. We keep S-Oil as our sector top pick with an unchanged target price.

## WHAT’S THE STORY?

### 2Q review—misses consensus

S-Oil reported a 2Q operating loss of KRW344b (worsening KRW96.7b q-q), missing both FnGuide consensus (loss of KRW247.3b) and our forecast (loss of KRW196.2b). While the petrochemical and lube base oil units bettered our forecasts, the refining unit fell short significantly.

- **Refining unit**: S-Oil’s refining unit suffered an operating loss of KRW441.1b (worsening KRW384.3b q-q) in 2Q. Although Dubai oil prices held up well q-q in 2Q—averaging USD71.5/bbl in June vs USD72.6/bbl in March—they plunged q-q when considering only the last two months of each quarter (a period that has a larger impact on inventory valuation)—i.e., prices averaged USD67.8/bbl over May-June vs USD73.9/bbl over February-March. Also, the won strengthened 5% q-q against the US dollar in 2Q. These developments likely resulted in: 1) a KRW175b inventory valuation loss (vs a gain of KRW11.6b in 1Q); and 2) negative lag effects—i.e., the gap between lagging margin and spot margin deteriorated from -USD0.1/bbl in 1Q to -USD1.1/bbl in 2Q. Meanwhile, spot margin rose from USD8.9/bbl in 1Q to USD10.9/bbl in 2Q as geopolitical risk in the Middle East spiked over May-June.
