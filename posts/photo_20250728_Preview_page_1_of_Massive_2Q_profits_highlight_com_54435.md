# SK Hynix (000660)

## Massive 2Q profits highlight competitiveness

- SK Hynix has just reported another positive earnings surprise, backed by remarkably shipments of commodity memory. We reiterate BUY with an unchanged target price of KRW340,000.
- Working with clients in the HBM development stage is crucial to extracting a premium for finished HBM products. Only a handful of chipmakers are expected to trade at a premium.
- Solid HBM demand combined with chronic shortages of memory semiconductors have cleared the Korean firm's 2026 earnings visibility.

## WHAT'S THE STORY?

### Investment strategy—environment changes, but growth continues:
While real competition is about to begin in the HBM arena (where state-of-the-art chips have already sold out amid a tight supply), investors need to temper their short-term expectations. Still, we forecast that SK Hynix’s shares will soon start reflecting solid 2026 earnings expectations, believing that demand for AI remains strong and that the Korean chipmaker’s profit-generating capabilities are stable. Our target price of KRW340,000 is based on 1.7x 2026 P/B, which represents the upper end of its 2025 P/B range. The figure looks attainable, even though valuation discounts are often seen late in the industry cycle. The stock remains a BUY.

### 2Q review—another earnings surprise:
SK Hynix reported 2Q sales of KRW22.2t (up 26% q-q and 35% y-y) and an operating profit of KRW9.2t (up 24% q-q and 68% y-y; beating FnGuide-based consensus by 2%). The remarkable earnings owed much to commodity memory (rather than HBM) and sales volume growth (rather than prices). Its top-line growth was fueled by customers’ inventory stocking of commodity memory ahead of possible tariffs amid a chronic shortage of commodity memory (stemming from chipmakers’ focus on HBM).
