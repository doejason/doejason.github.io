# Hana Financial Group (086790)
Confirms ability to improve asset quality

- Hana Financial Group (HFG) reported a 2Q net profit of KRW1.1t. HFG announced that it would buy back KRW200b worth of its shares in 3Q.
- Its loan growth recovered to 2.1% q-q, banking NIM stayed flat q-q, and credit cost (CCR) remained at a sector low of 0.3%. Its CET-1 ratio hit 13.39%.
- We keep the stock as our sector top pick, as: 1) it still trades at an attractive valuation (0.62x 2025 P/B); 2) it should enjoy steady earnings improvement; and 3) its payout ratio should rise gradually.

## WHAT'S THE STORY?

### 2Q review:
Hana Financial Group (HFG) reported a 2Q net profit of KRW1.1t, up 13.4% y-y and 4% q-q—beating consensus by 6.2%. HFG recognized KRW105.2b in forex-related gains, while booking provisioning on overseas alternative assets at non-banking affiliates (securities and capital). Excluding one-off factors, we believe the group’s recurring profit is still improving—positive.

### Announces KRW200b share buyback plan for 3Q—additional buyback plan for 4Q to be key:
HFG announced that it would buy back KRW200b worth of its shares in 3Q. If the firm adds a further KRW200b share buyback in 4Q, we estimate its payout ratio would hit 46.5% this year based on the consensus for its 2025 earnings (similar to Shinhan Financial Group’s 46% payout ratio) or 43.2% if we use our more optimistic earnings estimate. We however see the chances of the firm raising its share buyback in 4Q to KRW225b.
