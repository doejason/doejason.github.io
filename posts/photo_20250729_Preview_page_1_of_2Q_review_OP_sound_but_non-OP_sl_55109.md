# HL Mando (204320)

## 2Q review: OP sound but non-OP sluggish

- HL Mando’s 2Q operating profit beat estimates, as its IDB2 plant in Mexico ran at higher utilization despite tariff impact and as its sales to Chinese clients were strong. On the non-operating side, it performed sluggishly due to interest costs and valuation losses on its equity stake.
- North American profitability improvement has been an enterprise-wide earnings driver. Profitability should further improve in 2H, as it will be compensated by clients for some of tariff costs.
- Once a North American EV maker steps up production of affordable models, the company should emerge as a beneficiary.
