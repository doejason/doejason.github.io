# Shinhan Financial Group
**(055550)**  
Expedites payout ratio target timeline

- Shinhan Financial Group (SFG) reported a 2Q net profit of KRW1.55t. Meanwhile, SFG announced a KRW600b share buyback program in 2H.
- The group’s credit costs (CCR) rose to 0.59% in 2Q amid its loans growing 0.4% q-q and banking unit NIM staying flat q-q.
- We maintain our positive stance on SFG, expecting its valuation to continue recovering amid solid earnings improvement and payout ratio improvement.

## WHAT'S THE STORY?

### 2Q net profit hits KRW1.55t, continuing solid earnings growth:
Shinhan Financial Group (SFG) reported a 2Q net profit of KRW1.55t (up 8.7% y-y and 4.1% q-q), beating consensus by 7.2%. SFG recognized an additional, one-off provisioning of KRW79.3b, but it saw non-interest income grow KRW325.7b q-q—ie, financial investments-, and currency-/derivatives-related gains were up KRW326.9b q-q—which led its solid 2Q earnings.

### Announces KRW600b share buyback program in 2H—2025 payout ratio to hit 46%:
SFG announced a KRW600b share buyback program for 2H (an additional KRW200b buyback should be executed in Jan 2026). We estimate the group will return a total of KRW2.4t to shareholders in 2025, achieving its payout ratio target of 46%.
