# ST Pharm (237690)
**Earnings turn around on commercial ramp-up**

- **2Q review:** ST Pharm’s profitability improved, thanks to the supply of commercial volumes of Geron’s Rytelo (blood cancer treatment).
- **Maintaining BUY and target of KRW110,000:** Commercial volumes should grow sharply through 2026, in line with clients’ clinical progress.

## WHAT’S THE STORY?

**2Q review:** ST Pharm reported 2Q consolidated sales of KRW68.2b (up 52.8% y-y and 30% q-q) and an operating profit of KRW12.8b (turning around y-y and up 1,150.5% q-q)—the latter beating FnGuide consensus by 91.6%. Sales of: 1) small-molecule drugs grew 312.2% y-y and 509.1% q-q to KRW6.7b; 2) oligonucleotides rose 83.0% y-y and 15.7% q-q to KRW43.5b; and 3) generics increased 19.7% y-y and 67.9% q-q to KRW8.9b. Profitability improved for both oligonucleotides and small-molecule drugs, as a growing percentage of sales stemmed from commercialized volumes of the drug. Order backlog hit a record KRW380b (including KRW320b in oligonucleotides) thanks to expanded contracts with US biotech clients.

**Maintaining BUY and target price of KRW110,000:** We reiterate our target price based on a DCF valuation. ST Pharm will probably receive additional orders relating to Novartis’s Leqvio (hyperlipidemia). Its client Ionis Pharmaceuticals is likely to advance pipeline drugs through clinical trials in 2026, announcing: 1) Phase III HORIZON trial results and FDA submission for Pelacarsen (Lp(a)-related hyperlipidemia; in partnership with Novartis; targeting more than 8m patients globally requires up to 8,000 tonnes of API); 2) Phase IIb WELL trial results and FDA submission for Bepirovirsen (HBV; targeting 100,000 high-risk patients globally requires 800kg of API); and 3) Phase III IMAGINATION trial results for Sefaxersen (IgA nephropathy; in partnership with Roche).
