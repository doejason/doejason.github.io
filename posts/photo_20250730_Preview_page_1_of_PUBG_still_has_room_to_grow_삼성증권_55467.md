## Krafton (259960)
**PUBG still has room to grow**

- Krafton's 2Q operating profit missed consensus by 8.5%, as PUBG sales suffered on seasonal weakness and delayed promotions.
- We expect PUBG sales to rebound in 2H when a variety of collaborations are set for launch.
- As long as PUBG IP growth continues, we recommend investors to patiently wait till the firm secures new IPs.

## WHAT'S THE STORY?

### 2Q review:
Krafton's 2Q sales fell 24.3% q-q, missing consensus by 3.2%, as PUBG sales suffered on seasonal weakness and delayed promotions. Sales of inZOI halved q-q from over KRW30b in 1Q, contributing to the firmâ€™s sales miss. Despite falling sales, the firm saw rising commissions in relation to new title development and e-sports. Thus, its operating profit slipped 46.2% q-q in the quarter, missing consensus by 8.5%.

### Moves to secure new IP not going well...
New title inZOI saw traffic and sales plunge after its sales volume hit m copies, and the launch of next title SubNautica 2 has been delayed to 2026 due to a leadership shift in its development team. It looks like the firm has been experiencing difficulties in securing new IPs. Its plan is to achieve KRW3t in new IP sales within the next five years by recruiting new developers and bringing in more publishing contracts via M&As and equity investments. However, we find the visibility still low regarding any potential mega IP candidate.
