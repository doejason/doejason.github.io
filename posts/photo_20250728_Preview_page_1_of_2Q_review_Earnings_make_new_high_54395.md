# Hyundai Glovis (086280)
## 2Q review: Earnings make new high

- Hyundai Glovis reported an all-time high sales of KRW7.5t (up 6.4% y-y) and operating profit of KRW538.9b (up 22.7% y-y; meeting consensus) in 2Q.
- While sales were robust across all operations, operating profit was driven by the shipping division.
- We slightly raise our earnings estimates and increase our SOTP-based target price to KRW200,000 (based on 9x 2025 P/E) and maintain our BUY rating.

## WHAT’S THE STORY?

**Logistics:** Domestic logistics sales held steady y-y in 2Q on sales-mix improvement, despite declining sales volume of finished vehicles at domestic plants. Overseas logistics sales expanded 6.3% y-y to KRW2.1t, backed by increase in: 1) land transportation volume of finished vehicles; and 2) component trade volume. Accordingly, the logistics division saw 2Q operating profit remain similar y-y at KRW203.3b for an operating margin of 7.9% (down 0.5ppt y-y).

**Shipping:** PCTC sales grew 7.1% y-y on expansion of high-margin non-captive orders. Even though the 2Q BDI average slipped 21% y-y to 1,467, bulk-carrier sales remained flat y-y on a rise in wet bulk shipments. The shipping division’s sales and operating profit grew a respective 5.6% and 15.5% y-y to KRW1.36t and KRW200.2b for an operating margin of 14.7% (up 8.6ppts y-y). The remarkable earnings improvement owed much to easing of congestion at major harbors and better efficiency for fleet operation (eg, reduction of short-term chartered vessels).

**Distribution:** The distribution division’s sales rose 6.7% y-y to KRW3.6t but operating profit fell 14.4% y-y to KRW135.4b due to: 1) a high base from one-off gains in 2Q24; and 2) the forex valuation loss related with non-ferrous metals transactions.
